# WGAN-GP-With-REM
This repository contains the main classes and functions needed to understand how to replicate the experiments on your data.
All our experiments were conducted on the IBISC lab server using an NVIDIA A40 GPU. Due to memory constraints and the large number of experiments, we have included only the main experiments and scripts from the server in this repository.

# Requirements
Install the required python librairies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
